## Description

High Level OS for `x86-64/IA-64/ARM` architecture processors.

Commonly it's Kernel, just with stdout & stdin interfaces via terminal.

I wanna to make unix-like syscalls/commands system and as is open the `HTTP API` for more global extending the OS via many other remote modules wich will be able to work with `OS Kernel` throughout `NET` packages transport protocols.
